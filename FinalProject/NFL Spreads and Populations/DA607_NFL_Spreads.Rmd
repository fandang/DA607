![What Happens in DA607...](nfl-betting-odds-lines.png)

# Introduction

* Vegas bookies create the spreads for NFL Football games.
* They don't care if the spread is "correct", they want 50% of betters to choose each team (guaranteeing their "rake")
* If betters favor certain matchup attributes, perhaps this can be exploited.

# Factors to Analyze

* __Historic NFL Lines:__ Does a teams historical performance against the spread create bias on the current spread?  Example: How often have they covered in the past?
* __Harris Poll Popularity Rankings:__ Does a teams "popularity", as measured by the Harris Poll, create betting bias?
* __City Populations:__ Does the size of the city, and thus their "betting population", create bias in the spreads?
* __Game Location:__ How often does the Home team cover the spread?
* __Points Scored:__ Does "how much they covered by" history affect the teams current spreads?
* __Stadium Attendance:__ Does the teams stadium attendance (percent of stadium capacity filled) show a betting bias that can be exploited?


# ESEMN Workflow

## Obtain + Scrub form the following 3 Data Sources

### Source 1: Historic NFL Lines

Download the Historic NFL Lines CSVs from web to disk:

https://github.com/mattrjacobs/nflspread/tree/master/files

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# dont want to keep downloading from web each time:

url_prefix <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattrjacobs/nflspread/master/files/nfl'

if(DO_DOWNLOAD_FILES){
  for(i in 1979:2013)
  {
    input_url <- paste(url_prefix,i,"lines.csv", sep="")
    output_file <- paste("lines/nfl",i,"lines.csv", sep="")
    download.file(input_url, destfile=output_file)
  }
}
```

### Source 2: Harris Poll - Scrape for Year-over-Year Team Rankings

This includes the "one data transformation operation", removing all equal (=) signs from the rankings table.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if(DO_HARRIS_POLL_FAVS){
 harris_tables <- readHTMLTable(HARRIS_POLL_URL, header = TRUE)
  harris_df <- harris_tables[[3]]
  colnames(harris_df)[1] <- "team"
  # some had = sign before numbers, got it out...
  harris_df <- as.data.frame(sapply(harris_df,gsub,pattern="=",replacement=""))
  numeric_cols <- c(2:ncol(harris_df))
  harris_df[, numeric_cols] <- sapply(harris_df[, numeric_cols], as.numeric)
  harris_df$MEAN_RANK <- rowMeans(subset(harris_df, select = numeric_cols), na.rm = TRUE)
  harris_sub <- c(ncol((harris_df)-5):(ncol(harris_df)-1))
  harris_df$MEAN_RANK_5 <- rowMeans(subset(harris_df, select = harris_sub), na.rm = TRUE)
  kable(head(harris_df[,-c(4:12)]))
}

```

See above for MEAN of rankings, and below for graphcs of team's mean ranks.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
the_aes <- aes(x=reorder(team,-MEAN_RANK), y=MEAN_RANK)
plt <- ggplot(harris_df, the_aes) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
plt <- plt + ggtitle("Average Year-over-Year HARRIS POLL 'RANK'") + labs(x="team", y="MEAN RANK")
plt <- plt + stat_summary(fun.y=sum, geom="bar") 
plt <- plt + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
show(plt)
```

### Source 3: City Populations

Data was copy-pasted from the following Wikipedia Link:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population

and in the following manner:


```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

  df[, "pop"] <- 0

  df[df$team == "New York Giants", "pop"] <- 8491079
  df[df$team == "Green Bay Packers", "pop"] <- 104891

  # same for the rest of the teams....not showing here (too many lines...)
}

# Work

In these steps, just gathering the data and raw calculations, will do analysis in "Conclusions")

### Work 1: Load the downloaded CSVs of historical games into a Data Frame.

DataFrame created: "lines_df""

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
lines_df <- read.csv(paste("lines/nfl",1978,"lines.csv", sep=""))
lines_df['season'] <- 1978
for(i in 1979:2013)
{
  filepath <- paste("lines/nfl",i,"lines.csv", sep="")
  #print(filepath)
  lines_df_new <- read.csv(filepath)
  lines_df_new['season'] <- i
  lines_df <- rbind(lines_df, lines_df_new)
}

colnames(lines_df) <- c("date","v_team","v_score","h_team","h_score","line","total", "season")
```

### Work 2: New Field: "h_covered": Did the HOME team "cover"?

DataFrame updated: "lines_df""

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
lines_df$h_covered <- ((lines_df$v_score + lines_df$line) > lines_df$h_score)
kable(head(lines_df))

# Just confirming the rowcounts are good...winners + losers == rowcount
lines_df_home_covered <- sum(lines_df$h_covered==TRUE)
lines_df_home_didnt_cover <- sum(lines_df$h_covered==FALSE)

# confirm it adds up to total number of rows:
sum(lines_df_home_covered, lines_df_home_didnt_cover) == nrow(lines_df)

```

### Work 3: Choose 2013 Season to Analyze

Subset the spreads data, only take 2013 (the most recent):

DataFrame updated: "lines_df""

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
lines_df <- lines_df[lines_df$season == 2013,]
kable(head(lines_df))
```

### Work 4: Create 'Winner Points' Data Subset:

DataFrame created: "covered_by_summary_df"

How much did you score when you won?

Its a union of home_points when home_covered and away_points when not(home_covered)

Therefore, your times covered matter (because you only get the points if you covered) and the total points matter (because we're summing up the points on the days that you covered)

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
covered_by_summary_home_away <- sqldf("select h_team as team, sum(h_score) as winner_points from lines_df where h_covered group by team union select v_team as team, sum(v_score) as winner_points from lines_df where not(h_covered) group by team ", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

covered_by_summary_df <- sqldf("select team, sum(winner_points) as winner_points from covered_by_summary_home_away group by team order by winner_points desc", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
kable(head(covered_by_summary_df))

```

### Work 6: Merge the h_score and v_score logic (turn into times covered)

DataFrame created: "times_covered_df"

Subset the spreads data, only take 2013 (the most recent):

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
covered_count_home_away <- sqldf("select h_team as team, count(*) as times_covered from lines_df where h_covered group by team union select v_team as team, count(*) as times_covered from lines_df where not(h_covered) group by team ", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

times_covered_df <- sqldf("select team, sum(times_covered) as times_covered from covered_count_home_away group by team order by times_covered desc", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

kable(head(times_covered_df[,]))
```


### Work 7: Stadium Attendance

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
attendance_df <- read.csv("Stadium_Attendance.csv")
kable(head(attendance_df))
```


### Work 8: Populations (and start the merge...)

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
final_df <- do_explicit_populations(covered_by_summary_df)
kable(head(final_df))
```


### Work (FINAL MERGE): All into single data frame for Analysis:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
harris_to_merge <- harris_df[ , which(names(harris_df) %in% c("team","MEAN_RANK","MEAN_RANK_5"))]
final_df <- merge(final_df,times_covered_df,by="team")
final_df <- merge(final_df,harris_to_merge,by="team")
attendance_df_to_merge <- attendance_df[ , which(names(attendance_df) %in% c("team","Capacity.percentage"))]
final_df <- merge(final_df,attendance_df_to_merge,by="team")

kable(head(final_df))
```

# The Calculations

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# final_df$team + 
final_lm <- lm(final_df$times_covered ~ final_df$winner_points + final_df$pop + final_df$MEAN_RANK + final_df$MEAN_RANK_5 + final_df$Capacity.percentage)

summary(final_lm)


times_covered_ig <- information.gain(times_covered~., final_df)

print(times_covered_ig)

```

# Conclusions

There are flaws in the logic here:

* The spreads Data is from 2013 while the "favorites"" data 2015
* Picked random number of years for Harris Poll averages (ie 5 and ALL for which years to summarize)
* Not looking at many other factors, such as win streaks, player statistics, etc.
* Some stats are slightly circular: The team ranks may be determined by how often they cover

With those flaws in mind, there seems to be some factors that could be significant:

* There's only a __6% chance__ that the stadium capacity % is due to chance.
* __The MEAN RANKS:__ The fact that the __OVERALL MEAN RANK__ has more significance than the __5 YEAR MEAN RANK__ is interesting. Do "winners" go to historically strong teams?  If nothing else, it may show that betters care more about "recent history" than "historical tradition".

It would be quite interesting to look at statistics more historically to see if there was a point and time in which these predictions would have been more possible, when all of the indicators were not already in use to create the lines.
